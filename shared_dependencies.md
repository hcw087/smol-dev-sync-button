The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so all the components (Header.tsx, Footer.tsx, index.tsx, _app.tsx, _document.tsx) will use React for defining components and managing state.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience. The tsconfig.json file is the configuration file for TypeScript.

4. **CSS Modules**: The CSS Modules methodology is used in the Home.module.css file for styling the components. This methodology ensures that all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.

5. **Public Assets**: The public folder contains static assets like images (vercel.svg, favicon.ico) that can be used across the application.

6. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts, which are shared across the project.

7. **.next/config.js**: This is the configuration file for Next.js, which can contain shared settings for the application.

8. **DOM Elements**: The id names of DOM elements that JavaScript functions will use are shared across the components. These ids need to be unique across the application.

9. **Function Names**: Function names are shared across the components. These functions can be event handlers, utility functions, API calls, etc.

10. **Exported Variables**: Variables that are exported from one module and used in another are shared dependencies. These can include React components, utility functions, constants, etc.
